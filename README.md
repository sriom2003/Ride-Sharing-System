Ride Sharing System
Project Overview

The Ride Sharing System is a backend-oriented application designed to simulate the core functionalities of a ride-hailing platform. The system manages users and drivers, allows ride requests, assigns available drivers, calculates fares, and tracks ride status. The project focuses on backend logic, object-oriented programming, and real-world problem-solving rather than frontend development.

Objectives

To understand backend system design for ride-based applications

To implement core ride allocation and fare calculation logic

To apply object-oriented programming principles in a real-world scenario

To simulate how ride-sharing platforms operate at a basic level

⚙️ Features

User and driver registration

Ride request creation

Automatic assignment of available drivers

Ride status tracking (requested, ongoing, completed)

Fare calculation based on distance and ride completion

Basic error handling (no drivers available, invalid requests)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python / C++ (use the one you implemented)

Core Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Data Structures: Lists, Maps / Hash Tables

Architecture: Backend logic based system

Interface: Command Line Interface (CLI)

🧩 System Design (High Level)

User requests a ride

System checks for available drivers

Nearest or first available driver is assigned

Ride status is updated dynamically

Fare is calculated once the ride is completed

▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-link>


Navigate to the project directory:

cd ride-sharing-system


Run the program:

python main.py


(or compile and run if using C++)

📈 Learning Outcomes

Improved understanding of backend workflows

Practical experience with OOP and system design

Learned how real-world ride-sharing logic works

Enhanced problem-solving and debugging skills
